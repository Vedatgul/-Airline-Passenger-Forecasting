📌 Introduction
This notebook focuses on time series forecasting using the classic Airline Passenger dataset (1949–1960).
The goal is to build an ARIMA model to capture trend, seasonality, and noise in the data and forecast future passenger counts.

🎯 Key Insights
Time series needs to be stationary before ARIMA modeling.
AIC optimization helps in selecting the best model parameters.
ARIMA provides solid results for datasets with trend and seasonality.
